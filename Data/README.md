## Here are the data used for simulations and visualization in this study:
## **Data**
- `trunk_sample_input_data` : Sample input files for the trunk temperature models in three different locations.
- `lizard_raw_output` : Raw output dataframes generated by our lizard biophysical model. These data is then processed by the code in `Code/pre_analysis` to generate the data in `lizard_output_for_analysis`,
- `lizard_output_for_analysis` : Calculated dataframes used to calculate the statistics and figures.
