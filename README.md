### **Abstract**:
Habitat loss poses a major threat to global biodiversity. Many studies have explored the potential damages of deforestation to animal populations, but few have considered trees as thermoregulatory microhabitats or addressed how tree loss might impact the fate of species under climate change. Using a biophysical approach, we explored how tree loss might affect diurnal ectotherms under current and projected future climates. We found that tree loss could reduce lizard population growth by curtailing activity time and the length of the activity season. While climate change could generally promote population growth, deforestation could reverse these positive effects for 66% of simulated populations and further accelerate population declines for another 18%. Our research underscores the mechanistic link between tree availability and population survival and growth, advocating for forest conservation and the integration of biophysical modeling and microhabitat diversity into conservation strategies, particularly in the face of climate change.
